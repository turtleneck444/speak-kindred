# Rehman AI - Executive Summary

## üåü **The Story Behind Rehman AI**

**Rehman AI** is named in honor of Rehman, a beloved nephew whose life changed forever after a devastating car crash left him disabled and wheelchair-bound. Unable to speak, Rehman relies on an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) app to express his thoughts, needs, and feelings‚Äîto tell his family he loves them, to ask for help, to share his hopes and dreams.

Watching Rehman struggle with expensive, limited AAC devices that cost thousands of dollars, we realized something fundamental: **communication is a human right, not a luxury**. No family should have to choose between financial security and giving their loved one a voice.

**Rehman AI was built to change that.**

## üí° **What is Rehman AI?**

**Rehman AI** is a free, comprehensive Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) application designed for individuals who cannot speak due to:
- Traumatic injuries (like Rehman's car crash)

- Autism spectrum disorders
- Stroke or aphasia
- Locked-in syndrome
- Temporary voice loss
- And many other conditions

### **The Problem We Solve:**

Traditional AAC devices cost **$5,000 to $15,000** and often:
- Require insurance approval (frequently denied)
- Have robotic, mechanical voices that sound inhuman
- Offer limited vocabulary and functionality
- Are locked to a single device
- Require expensive updates and maintenance
- Take months to learn and set up

## üéØ **What Does It Do?**

   - Voices have emotional inflection‚Äîthey sound happy when saying "I'm happy," concerned when saying "help"
   - Users can preview voices and select one that matches their personality
   - Falls back to system voices if needed (still free)

3. **Sentence Building**
   - Tap tiles to construct complete sentences: "I want" + "water" + "please" = "I want water please"
   - One-tap "Speak" button converts text to speech
   - Delete word, backspace, and clear functions for easy editing
   - Visual sentence display shows what will be spoken

4. **Emergency Communication**
   - Always-visible red emergency bar at the top
   - One-tap access to critical phrases: "I need help," "I'm in pain," "Emergency," "Call for assistance"
   - Ensures life-saving communication is never more than one tap away

5. **Smart Features**

   - **Recently Used** - Quick access to frequently used tiles
   - **Quick Phrases** - Pre-built sentences for common situations
